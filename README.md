# Holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

## Description

This project shows the initial stage of the Airbnb Clone project: The console component. Within this repository, you will find a command interpreter and a set of classes, including the BaseModel class and various classes derived from it, such as User, State, City, Place, and others. The command interpreter, much like a shell, can be activated to accept user input and execute specific operations for handling object instances.
